        <h2>• Charges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Charging method: For the paid services in PhotoSwift, you can complete the payment of membership fees through the IOS in-app purchase payment channel.</li>
            <li>Charging Standards: The charging standards are determined independently based on our operating costs, operating strategies, etc. (adjustments include but are not limited to promotions, price increases, etc.), and will be displayed to you on the relevant product service promotion and payment pages; if the relevant charging method changes during your purchase and renewal, the charging method actually accepted by us shall prevail; if the price of the relevant service is adjusted, it shall be based on the current effective price announced by us (unless we have otherwise agreed with you). Please read the relevant notice carefully before deciding whether to renew.</li>
            <li>Subscription Period: The subscription period is 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year, and users can choose.</li>
            <li>Automatic Renewal Rules:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Automatic renewal refers to the service launched on the premise that users have activated the PhotoSwift VIP service, based on the user's demand for automatic renewal to avoid failure to renew in time due to negligence or other reasons. If you choose to activate the automatic renewal service, PhotoSwift will issue a deduction instruction according to the deduction rules of the third-party payment channel when the subscription period is about to expire, and deduct the fees for the next billing period from the account without verifying the member account password, payment password, SMS verification code and other information.</li>
                    <li>PhotoSwift will automatically deduct the fee one day before the service expires. If the balance of your subscription account is insufficient to pay for the PhotoSwift service fee for the next period, PhotoSwift will make a second automatic deduction at irregular intervals on the day after the first automatic deduction fails. If the balance of your third-party account is still insufficient to pay for the PhotoSwift service fee for the next period during the second automatic deduction, PhotoSwift will automatically stop providing PhotoSwift VIP services. You will bear the risks and/or losses caused by insufficient deductible balance in the above account.</li>
                    <li>The automatic renewal deduction date is the day before the subscription period expires. Once the deduction is successful, PhotoSwift will activate the PhotoSwift service corresponding to this billing period for you.</li>
                    <li>PhotoSwift hereby reminds you that the amount of PhotoSwift service fees you pay for this billing cycle shall be based on the automatic renewal price agreed upon with PhotoSwift when you activate the PhotoSwift service. However, in the event that PhotoSwift carries out activities or other circumstances in which PhotoSwift has other agreements with you, the aforementioned amount shall be based on the relevant agreement between PhotoSwift and you. At the same time, if you activate the PhotoSwift service again after unsubscribing, the amount of PhotoSwift service fees you pay for this billing cycle shall be based on the automatic renewal price agreed upon with PhotoSwift when you activate the service again.</li>
                    <li>How to cancel automatic renewal: Open the "Settings" of your iPhone, enter "iTunes Store and App Store", click "Apple ID", select "View Apple ID", enter the "Account Settings" page, click "Subscription", and select "PhotoSwift" to cancel the subscription.</li>
